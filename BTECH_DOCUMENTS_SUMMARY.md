## 💡 If Things Go Wrong

### Demo Fails
**Plan B**: Show backup video
> "Let me show you a recorded demo while we troubleshoot..." [Play video]

### Can't Answer a Question
**Template Response**:
> "That's a great question. I don't have the exact details at hand, but let me refer to our technical documentation. The key point is [what you do know]. What I can tell you is our system achieves [impressive result]."

### Technical Question Too Deep
**Pivot Strategy**:
> "While I'm not 100% certain about [specific detail], what I can show you is the actual implementation in our code. [Open relevant file] Here's how we [related thing you do know]."

### Comparison Question
**Always have data ready**:
> "Great question! We actually benchmarked against [tool]. Here's the data [show Slide 15 or technical doc Section 7]. We achieve X% accuracy at Y% of the cost."
